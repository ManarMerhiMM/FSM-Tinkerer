            <h1>Exercise 3 – Applications of Finite State Machines (FSMs)</h1>

            <p>
                Finite State Machines are models of computation that operate with a finite set of
                states and react to inputs or stimuli by moving between these states. A
                <strong>state</strong> represents a mode of operation at a given moment, and a
                <strong>transition</strong> represents how the system reacts when an event occurs.
                Whenever we need to describe or implement behavior that depends on patterns of
                events, FSMs are a natural fit. They appear in digital logic, embedded systems,
                communication protocols, and control software.
            </p>

            <p>
                The two examples below connect FSMs to everyday engineering systems:
                a traffic light controller and a vending machine controller.
            </p>

                <h2>Application 1 – Traffic Light Control System</h2>

                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most common examples of an FSM is a traffic light controller at an
                    intersection. It controls the flow of vehicles and pedestrians using light
                    signals (Green, Yellow, Red) based mainly on timing. The FSM guarantees that
                    opposite directions are never green at the same time and that pedestrians are
                    only allowed to cross at safe moments.

                </table>

                <h3>3. Explanation of Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    The FSM starts in <strong>S₁</strong> (Main Green). After the main-road
                    green timer expires, it moves to yellow then to an all-red safety state.
                    Depending on whether a pedestrian has requested to cross, the FSM either
                    switches to <strong>S₆</strong> (Pedestrian Walk) or gives green to the side
                    road. Eventually the controller cycles back to the main-road green. Because
                    both the states and transitions are carefully defined, there is never a
                    situation where both directions are green at the same time.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Example Run</h3>
                <p>
                    One example sequence is:
                    Main Road Green (30 s) → Yellow (5 s) → All-Red (2 s) → Pedestrian Walk
                    (10 s) → Pedestrian Flash (5 s) → Side Road Green → then repeat.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Advantages</h3>

                    <li>Easy to extend to multiple intersections</li>
                    <li>Ensures safety and proper coordination of vehicles and pedestrians</li>

                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    A vending machine that accepts coins and dispenses products based on the
                    amount paid can also be modeled as an FSM. Each state corresponds to the
                    current credit or operating mode, and transitions occur when coins are
                    inserted, items are selected, or special conditions like timeout or out-of-stock
                    are detected.

                <h3>3. Explanation of Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    The vending machine starts in the <strong>Idle</strong> state waiting for a
                    coin. When coins are inserted it moves to an accepting state and accumulates
                    credit. Once the credit is sufficient, the user is prompted to select an item.
                    A valid selection leads to a dispensing state, followed by returning any
                    change. If the user cancels or the selected item is empty, the FSM moves to a
                    refund state and returns the balance before going back to Idle. When stock is
                    completely depleted, the machine indicates “Out of Stock” until it is
                    restocked.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Example Operation Traces</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Idle → coin_inserted → coin_inserted → Sufficient Credit → Select Item → Dispensing → Returning
                        Change → Idle</li>
                    <li>Accepting → cancel → Refunding → Idle</li>
                    <li>Stock Empty → Out of Stock → Restocked → Idle</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. FSM Properties</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deterministic transitions for each possible input</li>
                    <li>Safe handling of errors and refunds</li>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    These two examples show how FSMs provide a structured way to capture system
                    behavior. In the traffic light controller, FSMs enforce safe signal ordering
                    and coordination. In the vending machine, they manage monetary logic and user
                    interaction. Because FSMs are deterministic and well-defined, they are a core
                    tool in digital design and control applications.
